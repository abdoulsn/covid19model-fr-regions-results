# covid19model-fr-regions-results

This dataset is a derivative work from the Imperial College Study 
[Estimating the number of infections and the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on COVID-19 in 11 European countries](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-13-europe-npi-impact/).
This repository presents results for the forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic at French regional level.

The goal of this dataset is to open the access to the result of our simulations, we encourage:

- Suggesting runs, to validate specific behaviours.
- Making visualisation of the data that illustrate reliability.
- Analysis of the performance and forecasting.

This dataset is part of the [data against covid-19](https://opencovid19.fr/)
citizens' initiative for open data and open source code around the COVID-19
pandemic.
